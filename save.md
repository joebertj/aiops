# Awesh AI Initialization Issue - Debug Session

## Current Status
- **Issue**: AI showing "not ready" status in awesh prompt despite successful AI client test
- **Configuration**: `MODEL=gpt-5-mini`, `AI_PROVIDER=openai` in ~/.aweshrc
- **Test Results**: AI client works when tested directly with `test_ai.py`

## Key Findings

### 1. AI Client Test Results
- âœ… AI client initialization successful when tested directly
- âœ… Configuration loading works correctly
- âœ… Environment variables are being read properly
- âœ… OpenAI API connection established

### 2. Backend Architecture
- Backend is launched via `fork()` in `awesh.c` main function
- Backend process should initialize AI client in `initialize()` method
- AI status is tracked in `state.ai_status` (AI_LOADING, AI_READY, AI_FAILED)

### 3. Configuration
```bash
# ~/.aweshrc contents:
MODEL=gpt-5-mini
AI_PROVIDER=openai
VERBOSE=0
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### 4. Process Status
- Frontend (awesh) starts successfully
- Backend process is forked but AI status remains "not ready"
- Security agent starts successfully
- No error messages visible in verbose mode

## Debugging Steps Taken

1. âœ… Fixed security agent isolation (bypasses other agents for AI requests)
2. âœ… Fixed VERBOSE environment variable propagation to child processes
3. âœ… Updated AI model configuration to use OpenAI GPT-5-mini
4. âœ… Tested AI client directly - works correctly
5. ðŸ”„ **Current**: Investigating why backend AI initialization fails when run through frontend

## Next Steps to Investigate

### 1. Backend Process Launch
- Check if `start_backend()` function exists and is called correctly
- Verify backend process is actually starting
- Check for any errors in backend startup that might be suppressed

### 2. AI Initialization in Backend
- Verify `initialize()` method is being called in backend
- Check if AI client initialization is failing silently
- Look for any exceptions being caught and not reported

### 3. Socket Communication
- Verify frontend-backend socket communication is working
- Check if AI status updates are being sent from backend to frontend
- Ensure proper error handling in socket communication

### 4. Environment Variables
- Verify all environment variables are properly passed to backend process
- Check if virtual environment is being used correctly
- Ensure Python path is correct for backend execution

## Code Locations to Check

### Frontend (awesh.c)
- `start_backend()` function (around line 1280)
- Backend process forking logic
- AI status checking and display

### Backend (server.py)
- `initialize()` method (around line 55)
- AI client initialization
- Socket server startup
- Error handling and logging

### AI Client (ai_client.py)
- `initialize()` method
- OpenAI client creation
- System prompt loading

## Commands to Run for Debugging

```bash
# Check if backend process is running
ps aux | grep -E "(awesh|python)" | grep -v grep

# Run with verbose logging
VERBOSE=1 ~/.local/bin/awesh

# Test AI client directly
python3 -c "
import asyncio
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.cwd() / 'awesh_backend'))
from awesh_backend.config import Config
from awesh_backend.ai_client import AweshAIClient

async def test():
    config = Config.load(Path.home() / '.awesh_config.ini')
    ai_client = AweshAIClient(config)
    await ai_client.initialize()
    print('AI client ready!')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## Architecture Notes

- **3-Process Architecture**: Frontend (C), Backend (Python), Security Agent (C)
- **Communication**: Unix domain sockets for IPC
- **AI Access**: Only backend has AI environment variables and client
- **Security**: Security agent bypasses other agents for AI requests
- **Status Display**: Frontend shows AI status with emojis (ðŸ¤– for loading, âœ… for ready)

## TODO Items
- [ ] Find and examine `start_backend()` function in awesh.c
- [ ] Check backend process startup and error handling
- [ ] Verify AI initialization is being called in backend
- [ ] Test socket communication between frontend and backend
- [ ] Check for any suppressed error messages
- [ ] Verify virtual environment usage in backend launch
