AIops System Design for Cursor AI Integration
Overview
This AIops system enables natural language-driven infrastructure management with autonomous state tracking, secure credential handling, and direct API/protocol execution. It aims to streamline operations by allowing humans to give simple commands while the AI manages clarifications, execution, and state reconciliation seamlessly.

A core philosophy is that the AI should bypass traditional human-oriented tools (like CLI utilities such as kubectl) and instead call APIs directly whenever possible, removing unnecessary abstraction layers and improving efficiency and reliability.

Core Features
1. Natural Language Human Input
Users provide commands in free text, e.g.,
“Make my deployment 3 replicas” or “Restart webserver example.com”.

The AI parses intents using advanced NLP/LLM techniques.

If commands lack detail, the AI asks clarifying questions interactively before proceeding.

2. Secure Credential & Access Management
Credentials (e.g., Kubernetes kubeconfig, SSH keys, cloud API tokens) are securely ingested.

AI stores access configs in encrypted JSON files for structured, easy retrieval.

Integration with password managers (.kbx files) or secret vaults can be added.

AI can proactively request missing or expired credentials from the user.

3. State Storage & Tracking
AI maintains a persistent state store containing:

Desired state (user commands and clarifications).

Actual state snapshots from querying live infrastructure.

Execution logs and error details.

State stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format for compactness and fast read/write operations.

Enables efficient diff computation between desired and actual states.

4. Planner and Executor Modules
Planner compares desired vs actual state to generate an actionable plan.

Executor performs actions by:

Calling APIs directly (e.g., Kubernetes REST API), bypassing human tools like kubectl.

Running SSH or WinRM commands for systems without APIs.

Execution is autonomous, no human in the loop once clarifications are resolved.

5. Interactive Clarification Loop
The AI engages in a back-and-forth dialog if the user input is ambiguous.

For example:

User: “Scale to 3 replicas.”
AI: “Which deployment do you want to scale?”
User: “webapp”

This loop ensures precise intent before state changes.

6. Example Workflow
Step	Description
User input	“Make my deployment 3 replicas”
AI clarifies	“Which deployment should I scale?”
User answers	“webapp”
AI updates state	Stores desired replicas=3 for deployment ‘webapp’
AI queries live	Checks current replica count in Kubernetes API
AI plans	Generates PATCH API call to scale deployment
AI executes	Applies scaling, logs success or errors
AI reports back	“Deployment webapp scaled to 3 replicas successfully”

Optional Enhancements
Security: Encryption of state and credentials to protect sensitive data.

Audit Logging: Maintain detailed history of commands and changes for compliance.

Multi-Cluster/Host Support: Manage multiple Kubernetes clusters and VM hosts via unified interface.

Error Handling: Intelligent retries and error recovery by the AI.

Extensibility: Plugins for additional protocols, cloud providers, or custom APIs.

System Components & Data Formats
Component	Role	Data Format / Tech
Input Parser	NLP/LLM-driven command parsing + clarification	Natural Language / JSON
Credential Store	Secure storage and retrieval of access data	JSON (encrypted)
State Store	Persistent desired & actual infrastructure state	BSON (fast binary format)
Planner	Diff engine generating actionable steps	Custom logic (Python etc.)
Executor	Executes API calls and commands	Kubernetes API (direct, no kubectl), SSH, WinRM
Interaction Layer	User dialog for clarifications	Chat UI, CLI, API

Integration with Cursor AI
Cursor AI’s code intelligence and LLM capabilities can be leveraged for:

Natural language understanding and intent extraction.

Generating API calls or command sequences programmatically.

Assisting in clarification dialogs.

Validating and generating JSON/BSON configs.

The AIops backend can be structured as a modular service that Cursor AI’s interface calls via APIs.
